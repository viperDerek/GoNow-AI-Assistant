FINAL DEVPOST SUBMISSION - COPY AND PASTE READY
=====================================================

A. GENERAL INFO
===============

Q1. Project Name:
GoNow: AI-Powered Smart Departure Assistant

Q2. Elevator Pitch:
Never be late again! GoNow uses Kiro AI to create Apple Watch alarms based on real-time navigation data. Built entirely through AI conversations - zero manual coding required!

B. PROJECT STORY
================

Q1. Inspiration:
I'm always late for meetings despite having all the technology at my fingertips - smartphone, GPS, calendar apps. The problem isn't lack of information, it's lack of intelligent coordination. I wanted to create something that would eliminate meeting lateness forever by automatically calculating when I need to leave and alerting me on my Apple Watch.

The inspiration came from realizing that while we have incredible technology, we still struggle with basic time management. I envisioned an AI-powered system that would think ahead for me, not just remind me when it's too late.

Q2. What it does:
GoNow is a revolutionary Apple ecosystem app that eliminates meeting lateness through intelligent automation:

‚Ä¢ Smart Calendar Integration: Monitors events tagged with "GoNow"
‚Ä¢ Real-Time Navigation: Calculates travel time using live traffic data
‚Ä¢ Apple Watch Alerts: Sends departure notifications with haptic feedback
‚Ä¢ Multi-Platform Sync: Works seamlessly across macOS, iOS, and watchOS
‚Ä¢ Intelligent Buffer: Adds 10-minute buffer to ensure early arrival
‚Ä¢ Navigation Choice: Integrates with Apple Maps and KakaoNavi

The magic happens automatically - just tag calendar events with "GoNow" and receive perfectly timed departure alerts on your Apple Watch!

Most importantly: This entire ecosystem was built through natural language conversations with Kiro AI. No manual coding required - I simply described what I wanted and Kiro generated thousands of lines of production-ready Swift code across all Apple platforms!

Q3. How we built it:
