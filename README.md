## 🏆 **Kiro AI Hackathon Winner**

**🤖 BUILT ENTIRELY WITH KIRO AI - ZERO MANUAL CODING!**

This project showcases the revolutionary potential of AI-assisted development. Every line of code, every feature, and every deployment script was generated through natural language conversations with Kiro AI.

## ✨ **What GoNow Does**

GoNow eliminates meeting lateness through intelligent automation across the entire Apple ecosystem:

- 📅 **Smart Calendar Integration**: Monitors events tagged with "GoNow"
- 🗺️ **Real-Time Navigation**: Calculates travel time using live traffic data
- ⌚ **Apple Watch Alerts**: Sends departure notifications with haptic feedback
- 🔄 **Multi-Platform Sync**: Works seamlessly across macOS, iOS, and watchOS
- ⏰ **Intelligent Buffer**: Adds 10-minute buffer to ensure early arrival
- 🧭 **Navigation Choice**: Integrates with Apple Maps and KakaoNavi

## 🎯 **How It Works**

1. **Tag Calendar Events**: Add "GoNow" to any calendar event with a location
2. **Automatic Monitoring**: GoNow continuously monitors your tagged events
3. **Smart Calculations**: Real-time traffic data determines optimal departure time
4. **Apple Watch Alerts**: Receive perfectly timed notifications on your wrist
5. **Never Be Late**: Arrive early and stress-free for every meeting!

## 🛠️ **Built With Kiro AI**

### **Development Process:**
1. **Described the Vision**: Explained the meeting lateness problem to Kiro in plain English
2. **Collaborative Design**: Worked with Kiro to architect the multi-platform solution
3. **AI Code Generation**: Kiro generated complete Swift applications for all platforms
4. **Automated Deployment**: Kiro created build scripts and deployment automation
5. **Real-Time Debugging**: Fixed issues through continued AI conversation
6. **Production Ready**: Deployed to all Apple devices in under 2 hours

### **Technical Achievement:**
- **2,000+ lines of Swift code** - all generated by Kiro AI
- **Multi-platform coordination** - seamless sync across Apple ecosystem
- **Real-time APIs** - traffic data integration and navigation services
- **Production deployment** - automated build and installation scripts
- **Zero manual coding** - everything created through natural language conversation
