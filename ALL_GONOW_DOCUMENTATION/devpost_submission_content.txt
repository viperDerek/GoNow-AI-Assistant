PROJECT TITLE:
GoNow: AI-Powered Smart Meeting Departure System - Built Entirely with Kiro AI

TAGLINE:
Never be late again! Revolutionary AI-powered meeting management that calculates optimal departure times and sends smart notifications across all your Apple devices.

INSPIRATION:
Being late for meetings is a universal problem that affects productivity and professional relationships. Despite having smartphones with GPS and calendar apps, people still struggle with timing their departures correctly. I wanted to create an intelligent system that would eliminate this problem forever by leveraging AI to predict optimal departure times and coordinate notifications across all devices.

The inspiration came from my own experience of being consistently late despite having all the technology at my fingertips. I realized the problem wasn't lack of information - it was lack of intelligent coordination between calendar, navigation, and notification systems.

WHAT IT DOES:
GoNow is a complete ecosystem that transforms how you manage meeting attendance:

Core Features:
• Smart Calendar Integration: Automatically monitors your iCalendar for events tagged with "GoNow"
• Real-Time Travel Calculations: Uses live traffic data to calculate precise travel times
• Multi-Platform Notifications: Sends departure alerts to macOS, iOS, and Apple Watch
• Navigation Integration: Works with Apple Maps and KakaoNavi for optimal routing
• Intelligent Buffer Time: Automatically adds 10-minute buffer to ensure early arrival
• Cross-Device Synchronization: Seamlessly syncs across all Apple devices via iCloud

User Journey:
1. Add "GoNow" tag to any calendar event with a location
2. GoNow monitors the event and calculates travel time 3 hours before
3. System determines optimal departure time (travel time + 10-minute buffer)
4. Receive haptic notification on Apple Watch when it's time to leave
5. Choose between Apple Maps or KakaoNavi for navigation
6. Arrive 10 minutes early, every time

Platform Coverage:
• macOS: Desktop monitoring and calendar management
• iOS: Mobile notifications and navigation integration
• watchOS: Haptic departure alerts and quick access

HOW WE BUILT IT:
This project showcases the revolutionary potential of AI-assisted development. The entire GoNow ecosystem was built through natural language conversations with Kiro AI Assistant - zero manual coding required.

Development Process:
1. Described the Vision: Explained the meeting lateness problem to Kiro
2. Collaborative Design: Worked with Kiro to design the multi-platform solution
3. AI Code Generation: Kiro generated complete Swift applications for all platforms
4. Automated Deployment: Kiro created deployment scripts and permission handling
5. Real-Time Testing: Debugged and refined through continued AI conversation
6. Production Deployment: Deployed to all Apple devices in under 2 hours

Technical Architecture:
• Swift/SwiftUI: Native Apple development for optimal performance
• EventKit: Deep calendar integration across all platforms
• CoreLocation: Precise location services and travel time calculation
